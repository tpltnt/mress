GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

 The terms of the latest and most up-to-date version of this License Agreement will always be published on the Hacktivismo Website, http://www.hacktivismo.com/.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, use and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, USE AND/OR MODIFICATION

0. DEFINITIONS. The following are defined terms that, whenever used in this License Agreement, have the following meanings:

0.1 Author: "Author" shall mean the copyright holder of an Original Work (the "Program") released by the Author under this License Agreement.

0.2 Copy: "Copy" shall mean everything and anything that constitutes a copy according to copyright law, without limitation. A "copy" does not become anything other than a "copy" merely because, for example, a governmental or institutional employee duplicates the Program or a part of it for another employee of the same institution or Governmental Entity, or merely because it is copied from one computer to another, or from one medium to another, or multiple copies are made on the same medium, within the same institutional or Governmental Entity.

0.3 Derivative Work: A "Derivative Work" or "work based on the Program" shall mean either the Program itself or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification."). In the unlikely event that, and to the extent that, this contractual definition of "Derivative Work" is later determined by any tribunal or dispute-resolution body to be different is scope from the meaning of "derivative work" under the copyright law of any country, then the broadest and most encompassing possible definition either the contractual definition of "Derivative Work," or any broader and more encompassing statutory or legal definition, shall control. Acceptance of this contractually-defined scope of the term "Derivative Work" is a mandatory pre-condition for You to receive any of the benefits offered by this License Agreement.

0.3.1 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a Derivative Work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License Agreement.

0.4 License Agreement: When used in this License Agreement, the terms "this License" or "this License Agreement" shall mean The Hactivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, v. 0.1, or any subsequent version made applicable under the terms of Section 15.

0.5 Licensee: The term "Licensee" shall mean You or any other Licensee, whether or not a Qualified Licensee.

0.6 Original Work: "Original Work" shall mean a Program or other work of authorship, or portion thereof, that is not a Derivative Work.

0.7 Program: The "Program," to which this License Agreement applies, is the Original Work (including, but not limited to, computer software) released by the Author under this License Agreement.

0.8 Qualified Licensee: A "Qualified Licensee" means a Licensee that remains in full compliance with all terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You are no longer a Qualified Licensee if, at any time, You violate any terms of this License Agreement. Neither the Program nor any Software based on the Program may be copied, distributed, performed, displayed, used or modified by You, even for Your own purposes, unless You are a Qualified Licensee. A Licensee other than a Qualified Licensee remains subject to all terms and conditions of this License Agreement, and to all remedies for each cumulative violation as set forth herein. Loss of the status of Qualified Licensee signifies that violation of any terms of the License Agreement subjects a Licensee to loss of most of the benefits that Qualified Licensees enjoy under this License Agreement, and to additional remedies for all violations occurring after the first violation.

0.9 Software: "Software" or "the Software" shall mean the Program, any Derivative Work based on the Program or a portion thereof, and/or any modified version of the Program or portion thereof, without limitation.

0.10 Source Code: The term "Source Code" shall mean the preferred form of a Program or Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to access and modify that Program or Original Work.

0.10.1 For an executable work, complete Source Code means all the Source Code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the Source Code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

0.10.2 "Object Code:" Because of certain peculiarities of current export-control rules, "object code" of the Program, or any modified version of the Program, or Derivative Work based on the Program, must not be exported except by way of distribution that is ancillary to the distribution of the Source Code. The "Source Code" shall be understood as the primary content transferred or exported by You, and the "object code" shall be considered as merely an ancillary component of any such export distribution.

0.11 Strong Cryptography: "Strong Cryptography" shall mean cryptography no less secure than (for example, and without limitation) a 2048-bit minimum key size for RSA encryption, 1024-bit minimum key size for Diffie-Hellman (El Gamal), or a 256-bit minimum key size for AES and similar symmetric ciphers.

0.12 Substandard Key-Selection Technique: The term "Substandard Key-Selection Technique" shall mean a method or technique to cause encryption keys to be more easily guessed or less secure, such as by (i) causing the selection of keys to be less than random, or (ii) employing a selection process that selects among only a subset of possible keys, instead of from among the largest set of possible keys that can securely be used consistent with contemporary knowledge about the cryptographic techniques employed by You. The following illustrations elaborate on the foregoing definition:

0.12.1 If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the encryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of one or more prime numbers, or involves one or more mathematical functions or concatenations performed on one or more prime numbers, then each prime number should be selected from a very large set of candidate prime numbers, but not necessarily from the set of all possible prime numbers (e.g., inclusion of the number 1 in the candidate set, for example, may in some instances reduce rather than enhance security), and absolutely not from any artificially small set of candidate primes that makes the guessing of a key easier than would be the case if a secure key-generation technique were employed. In all instances, the primes should be selected at random from among the candidate set. If there is a customary industry standard for maximizing the security associated with the key-generation or key-selection technique for the cryptosystem You select, then (with attention also to the requirements of Section 0.11), You should employ a key-generation or selection technique no less secure than the customary industry standard for secure use of the cryptosystem.

0.12.2 If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the encryption algorithm You employ involves the selection of a random integer, or the transformation of a random integer through one or more mathematical processes, then the selection of the integer shall be at random from the largest possible set of all possible integers consistent with the secure functioning of the encryption algorithm. It shall not be selected from an artificially small set of integers (e.g., if a 256-bit random integer serves as the key, then You could not set 200 of the 256 bits as "0," and randomly generate only the remaining 56 bits producing effectively a 56-bit keylength instead of using the full 256 bits).

0.12.3 In other words, Your key-generation technique must promote security to the maximum extent permitted by the cryptographic method(s) and keylength You elect to employ, rather than facilitating eavesdropping or surveillance in any way. The example of GSM telephones, in which 16 of 56 bits in each encryption key were set at "0," thereby reducing the security of the system by a factor of 65,536, is particularly salient. Such artificial techniques to reduce the security of a cryptosystem by selecting keys from only a less-secure or suboptimal subset of possible keys, is prohibited and will violate this License Agreement if any such technique is employed in any Software.

0.13 You: Each Licensee (including, without limitation, Licensees that have violated the License Agreement and who are no longer Qualified Licensees, but who nevertheless remain subject to all requirements of this License Agreement and to all cumulative remedies for each successive violation), is referred to as "You."

0.13.1 Governmental Entity: "You" explicitly includes any and all "Governmental Entities," without limitation. "Governmental Entity" or "Governmental Entities," when used in this License Agreement, shall mean national governments, sub-national governments (for example, and without limitation, provincial, state, regional, local and municipal governments, autonomous governing units, special districts, and other such entities), governmental subunits (without limitation, governmental agencies, offices, departments, government corporations, and the like), supra-national governmental entities such as the European Union, and entities through which one or more governments perform governmental functions or exercise governmental power in coordination, cooperation or unison.

0.13.2 Governmental Person: "You" also explicitly includes "Governmental Persons." The terms "Governmental Person" or "Governmental Persons," when used in this License Agreement, shall mean the officials, officers, employees, representatives, contractors and agents of any Governmental Entity.

1. Application of License Agreement. This License Agreement applies to any Program or other Original Work of authorship that contains a notice placed by the Author saying it may be distributed under the terms of this License Agreement. The preferred manner of placing such a notice is to include the following statement immediately after the copyright notice for such an Original Work:

    "Licensed under the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, Version 0.1" 

2. Means of Acceptance Use, Copying, Distribution or Modification By Anyone Constitutes Acceptance. Subject to Section 14.1 (concerning the special case of certain Governmental Entities) any copying, modification, distribution, or use by You of the Program or any Software, shall constitute Your acceptance of all terms and conditions of this License Agreement.

2.1 As a Licensee, You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person to use the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it (including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such person has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee subject to all its terms and conditions.

2.2 You may not make any copy for Your own use unless You have accepted this License Agreement and subjected yourself to all its terms and conditions.

2.3 You may not make a copy for the use of any other person, or transfer a copy to any other person, unless such person is a Licensee that has accepted this License Agreement and such person is subject to all terms and conditions of this License Agreement.

2.4 It is not the position of Hacktivismo that copyright law confers an exclusive right to use, as opposed to the exclusive right to copy the Software. However, for purposes of contract law, any use of the Software shall be considered to constitute acceptance of this License Agreement. Moreover, all copying is prohibited unless the recipient of a copy has accepted the License Agreement. Because each such recipient Licensee is contractually obligated not to permit anyone to access, use, or secure a copy of the Software, without first accepting the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, use by non-Licensees is effectively prohibited contractually because nobody can obtain a copy of, or access to a copy of, any Software without (1) accepting the License Agreement through use, and (2) triggering some Licensee's obligation to require acceptance as a precondition of copying or access.

3. "Qualified Licensee" Requirement: Neither the Program nor any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program may be copied, distributed, displayed, performed, used or modified by You, even for Your own purposes, unless You are a "Qualified Licensee." To remain a Qualified Licensee, You must remain in full compliance with all terms and conditions of this License Agreement.

4. License Agreement Is Exclusive Source of All Your Rights:

4.1 You may not copy, modify, or distribute the Program, or obtain any copy, except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, obtain a copy, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate Your rights under this License Agreement and subject You to all cumulative remedies for each successive violation that may be available to the Author. However, Qualified Licensees who have received copies from You (and thereby have received rights from the Author) under this License Agreement, and who would otherwise qualify as Qualified Licensees, will not have their rights under their License Agreements suspended or restricted on account of anything You do, so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

4.2 You are not required to accept this License Agreement and prior to the time You elect to become a Licensee and accept this License Agreement, You may always elect instead not to copy, use, modify, distribute, compile, or perform the Program or any Software released under this License Agreement. However, nothing else grants You permission to copy, to obtain or possess a copy, to compile a copy in object code or executable code from a copy in source code, to modify, or to distribute the Program or any Software based on the Program. These actions are prohibited by law if You do not accept this License Agreement. Additionally, as set forth in Section 2, any use, copying or modification of the Software constitutes acceptance of this License Agreement by You.

4.3 Each time You redistribute the Program (or any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a License Agreement from the Author to copy, distribute, modify, perform or display the Software, subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License Agreement. Enforcement is the responsibility of the Author.

5. Grant of Source Code License.

5.1 Source Code Always Available from Author: Author hereby promises and agrees except to the extent prohibited by export-control law to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Program at the request of any Licensee. Author reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the most current version of the Program in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for so long as Author continues to distribute the Program, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Program. Every copy of the Program distributed by Hacktivismo (but not necessarily every other Author) consists of the Source Code accompanied, in some instances, by an ancillary distribution of compiled Object Code, but the continued availability of the Source Code from the Author addresses the possibility that You might have (for any reason) not received from someone else a complete, current, copy of the Source Code (lack of which would, for example, prevent You from exporting copies to others without violating this license, see Section 8).

5.2 Grant of License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable copyright license to do the following:

5.2.1 to reproduce the Source Code of the Program in copies;

5.2.2 to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program and to edit or modify the Source Code in the process of preparing such Derivative Works;

5.2.3 to distribute copies of the Source Code of the Original Work and/or of Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed under this License Agreement, and that You shall fully inform all recipients of the terms of this License Agreement.

6. Grant of Copyright License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to do the following:

6.1 to reproduce the Program in copies;

6.2 to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program, or upon Software that itself is based on the Program;

6.3 to distribute (either by distributing the Source Code, or by distributing compiled Object Code, but any export of Object Code must be ancillary to a distribution of Source Code) copies of the Program and Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of the Program or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed under this License Agreement, that You shall fully inform all recipients of the terms of this License Agreement;

6.4 to perform the Program or a Derivative Work publicly;

6.5 to display the Program or a Derivative Work publicly; and

6.6 to charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy of the Program (You may also, at Your option, offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee).

7. Grant of Patent License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license Agreement, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Author that are embodied in the Program as furnished by the Author ("Licensed Claims") to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Program. Subject to the proviso that You grant all Licensees a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under any patent claims embodied in any Derivative Work furnished by You, Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license under the Licensed Claims to make, use, sell and offer for sale Derivative Works.

8. Exclusions From License Agreement Grants. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the Licensed Claims defined in Section 7. No right is granted to the trademarks of Author even if such marks are included in the Program. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be interpreted to prohibit Author from licensing under additional or different terms from this License Agreement any Original Work, Program, or Derivative Work that Author otherwise would have a right to License.

8.1 Implied Endorsements Prohibited. Neither the name of the Author (in the case of Programs and Original Works released by Hacktivismo, the name "Hacktivismo"), nor the names of contributors who helped produce the Program may be used to endorse or promote modifications of the Program, any Derivative Work, or any Software other than the Program, without specific prior written permission of the Author. Neither the name of Hacktivismo nor the names of any contributors who helped write the Program may be used to endorse or promote any Program or Software released under this License Agreement by any person other than Hacktivismo.

9. Modifications and Derivative Works. Only Qualified Licensees may modify the Software or prepare or distribute Derivative Works. If You are a Qualified Licensee, Your authorization to modify the Software or prepare or distribute Derivative Works (including permission to prepare and/or distribute Derivative Works, as provided in Sections 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.6) is subject to each and all of the following mandatory terms and conditions (9.1 through 9.6, inclusive):

9.1 You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change;

9.2 If the modified Software normally reads commands interactively when run, You must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that You provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under this License Agreement, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License Agreement. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, Your Derivative Work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.);

9.3 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You, that incorporates any portion of the Original Work, must not contain any code or functionality that subverts the security of the Software or the end-user's expectations of privacy, anonymity, confidentiality, authenticity, and trust, including (without limitation) any code or functionality that introduces any "backdoor," escrow mechanism, "spy-ware," or surveillance techniques or methods into any such Program, Software, or modification thereof;

9.4 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You, that employs any cryptographic or other security, privacy, confidentiality, authenticity, and/or trust methods or techniques, including without limitation any Derivative Work that includes any changes or modifications to any cryptographic techniques in the Program, shall employ Strong Cryptography.

9.5 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You, if it contains any key-generation or selection technique, must not employ any Substandard Key-Selection Technique.

9.6 No Program or Software copied or distributed by You may transmit or communicate any symmetric key, any "private key" if an asymmetric cryptosystem is employed, or any part of such key, nor may it otherwise make any such key or part of such key known, to any person other than the end-user who generated the key, without the active consent and participation of that individual end-user. If a private or symmetric key is stored or recorded in any manner, it must not be stored or recorded in plaintext, and it must be protected from reading (at a minimum) by use of a password. Use of steganography or other techniques to disguise the fact that a private or symmetric key is even stored is strongly encouraged, but not absolutely required.

10. Use Restrictions: Human Rights Violations Prohibited.

10.1 Neither the Program, nor any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program may used by You for any of the following purposes (10.1.1 through 10.1.5, inclusive):

10.1.1 to violate or infringe any human rights or to deprive any person of human rights, including, without limitation, rights of privacy, security, collective action, expression, political freedom, due process of law, and individual conscience;

10.1.2 to gather evidence against any person to be used to deprive any person of human rights;

10.1.3 any other use as a part of any project or activity to deprive any person of human rights, including not only the above-listed rights, but also rights of physical security, liberty from physical restraint or incarceration, freedom from slavery, freedom from torture, freedom to take part in government, either directly or through lawfully elected representatives, and/or freedom from self-incrimination;

10.1.4 any surveillance, espionage, or monitoring of individuals, whether done by a Governmental Entity, a Governmental Person, or by any non-governmental person or entity;

10.1.5 censorship or "filtering" of any published information or expression.

10.2 Additionally, the Program, any modification of it, or any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program may not be used by any Governmental Entity or other institution that has any policy or practice (whether official or unofficial) of violating the human rights of any persons.

10.3 You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person (including, without limitation, any Governmental Entity or Governmental Person) to use the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it (including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such person has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee subject to all its terms and conditions, including (without limitation) the use restrictions embodied in Section 10.1 and 10.2, inclusive.

11. All Export Distributions Must Consist of or Be Ancillary to Distribution of Source Code. Because of certain peculiarities of current export-control law, any distribution by You of the Program or any Software may be in the form of Source Code only, or in the form or Source Code accompanied by compiled Object Code, but You may not export any Software in the form of compiled Object Code only. Such an export distribution of compiled executable code must in all cases be ancillary to a distribution of the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed on a medium, or by a method, customarily used for software interchange.

12. EXPORT LAWS: THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ADDS NO RESTRICTIONS TO THE EXPORT LAWS OF YOUR JURISDICTION. It is Your responsibility to comply with any export regulations applicable in Your jurisdiction. From the United States, Canada, or many countries in Europe, export or transmission of this Software to certain embargoed destinations (including, but not necessarily limited to, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria), may be prohibited. If Hacktivismo is identified as the Author of the Program (and it is not the property of some other Author), then export to any national of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria, or into the territory of any of these countries, by any Licensee who has received this Software directly from Hacktivismo or from the Cult of the Dead Cow, or any of their members, is contractually prohibited and will constitute a violation of this License Agreement. You are advised to consult the current laws of any and all countries whose laws may apply to You, before exporting this Software to any destination. Special care should be taken to avoid export to any embargoed destination. An Author other than Hacktivismo may substitute that Author's legal name for "Hacktivismo" in this Paragraph, in relation to any Program released by that Author under this Paragraph.

13. Contrary Judgments, Settlements and Court Orders. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on You (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License Agreement, they do not excuse You from the conditions of this License Agreement. If You cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously Your obligations under this License Agreement and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence You may not distribute the Software at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through You, then the only way You could satisfy both it and this License Agreement would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

It is not the purpose of this Section 13 to induce You to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this Section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the software distribution system reflected in this License Agreement, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through related distribution systems, in reliance on consistent application of such distribution systems; it is up to the Author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a Licensee cannot impose that choice.

14. Governmental Entities: Any Governmental Entity ("Governmental Entity" is defined broadly as set forth in Section 0.13.1) or Governmental Person (as "Governmental Person" is defined broadly in Section 0.13.2), that uses, modifies, changes, copies, displays, performs, or distributes the Program, or any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program, may do so if and only if all of the following terms and conditions (14.1 through 14.10, inclusive) are agreed to and fully met:

14.1 If it is the position of any Governmental Entity (or, in the case of any "Governmental Person," if it is the position of that Governmental Person's Governmental Entity) that any doctrine or doctrines of law (including, without limitation, any doctrine(s) of immunity or any formalities of contract formation) may render this License Agreement unenforceable or less than fully enforceable against such Governmental Entity, or any Governmental Person of such Governmental Entity, then prior to any use, modification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution of the Program, or of any Software or Derivative Work based on the Program, or any part thereof, by the Governmental Entity, or by any Governmental Person of that Governmental Entity, the Governmental Entity shall be required to inform the Author in writing of each such doctrine that is believed to render this License Agreement or any part of it less than fully enforceable against such Governmental Entity or any Governmental Person of such entity, and to explain in reasonable detail what additional steps, if taken, would render the License Agreement fully enforceable against such entity or person. Failure to provide the required written notice to the Author in advance of any such use, modification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution, shall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver of any and all reliance on any doctrine, by the Governmental Entity, that is not included or that is omitted from the required written notice (failure to provide any written notice means all reliance on any doctrine is irrevocably waived). Any Governmental Entity that provides written notice under this subsection is prohibited, as are all of the Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity, from making any use, change, display, performance, copy, modification or distribution of the Software or any part thereof, until such time as a License Agreement is in place, agreed upon by the Author and by the Governmental Entity, that such entity concedes is fully-enforceable. Any use, modification, change, display, performance, copy, or distribution following written notice under this Paragraph, but without the implementation of an agreement as provided herein, shall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver by the Governmental Entity (and any and all Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity) of any and all reliance on any legal doctrine either referenced in such written notice or omitted from it.

14.2 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, or distributes, the Software or any part or portion thereof, or any Governmental Person who does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), permanently and irrevocably waives any defense based on sovereign immunity, official immunity, the Act of State Doctrine, or any other form of immunity, that might otherwise apply as a defense to, or a bar against, any legal action based on the terms of this License Agreement.

14.2.1 With respect to any enforcement action brought by the Author in a United States court against a foreign Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a "case . . . in which the foreign state has waived its immunity," within the scope of 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the "commercial activity" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(2), (3) are also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.

14.2.2 With respect to any enforcement action brought by an authorized end-user (as a third-party beneficiary, under the terms of Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10) in a United States court against a foreign Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a "case . . . in which the foreign state has waived its immunity," within the scope of 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). . Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the "commercial activity" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(2), (3) are also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.

14.2.3 With respect to any action or effort by the Author in the United States to execute a judgment against a foreign Governmental Entity, by attaching or executing process against the property of such Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a case in which "the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid of execution or from execution," in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1610(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the "commercial activity" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. 1610(a)(2), (d) are also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.

14.2.4 With respect to any action or effort brought by an authorized end-user (as a third-party beneficiary, in accordance with Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10) in the United States to execute a judgment against a foreign Governmental Entity, by attaching or executing process against the property of such Governmental Entity, the waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a case in which "the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid of execution or from execution," in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1610(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the "commercial activity" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. 1610(a)(2), (d) are also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.

14.3 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays, performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any Governmental Person who does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), and thereby violates any terms and conditions of Section 9 (restrictions on modification), or Paragraph 10 (use restrictions), agrees that the person or entity is subject not only to an action by the Author, for the enforcement of this License Agreement and for money damages and injunctive relief (as well as attorneys' fees, additional and statutory damages, and other remedies as provided by law), but such Governmental Entity and/or Person also shall be subject to a suit for money damages and injunctive relief by any person whose human rights have been violated or infringed, in violation of this License Agreement, or through the use of any Software in violation of this License Agreement. Any person who brings an action under this section against any Governmental Person or Entity must notify the Author promptly of the action and provide the Author the opportunity to intervene to assert the Author's own rights. Damages in such a third-party action shall be measured by the severity of the human rights violation and the copyright infringement or License Agreement violation, combined, and not merely by reference to the copyright infringement. All end-users, to the extent that they are entitled to bring suit against such Governmental Entity by way of this License Agreement, are intended third-party beneficiaries of this License Agreement. Punitive damages may be awarded in such a third-party action against a Governmental Entity or Governmental Person, and each and every such Governmental Entity or Person conclusively waives all restrictions on the amount of punitive damages, and all defenses to the award of punitive damages to the extend such limitations or defenses depend upon or are a function of such person or entity's status as a Governmental Person or Governmental Entity.

14.4 Any State of the United States, or any subunit or Governmental Entity thereof, that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays, performs, or distributes the Software of any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 -- any immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution or any other immunity doctrine (such as sovereign immunity or qualified, or other, official immunity) that may apply to state governments, subunits, or to their Governmental Persons.

14.5 Any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, any State of the United States), that uses, copies, changes, modifies, performs, displays, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 any doctrine (such as, but not limited to, the holding in the United States Supreme Court decision of Ex Parte Young) that might purport to limit remedies solely to prospective injunctive relief. Also explicitly and irrevocably waived is any underlying immunity doctrine that would require the recognition of such a limited exception for purposes of remedies. The remedies against such governmental entities and persons shall explicitly include money damages, additional damages, statutory damages, consequential damages, exemplary damages, punitive damages, costs and fees that might otherwise be barred or limited in amount on account of governmental status.

14.6 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays, performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 any and all reliance on the Act of State doctrine, sovereign immunity, international comity, or any other doctrine of immunity whether such doctrine is recognized in that government's own courts, or in the courts of any other government or nation.

14.6.1 Consistent with Subparagraphs 14.2.1 through 14.2.4, this waiver shall explicitly be understood to constitute a waiver not only against suit, but also against execution against property, for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). All United States Governmental Entities shall be understood to have agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity against (i) suit in the courts of other sovereigns, and (ii) execution against property of the United States located within the territory of other countries.

14.7 Governmental Persons, (i) who violate this License Agreement (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), or (ii) who are personally involved in any activity, policy or practice of a governmental entity that violates this License Agreement (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), or (iii) that use, copy, change, modify, perform, display or distribute, the Software or any part thereof, when their Governmental Entity is not permitted to do so, or is not a Qualified Licensee, or has violated the terms of this License Agreement, each and all individually waive and shall not be permitted to assert any defense of official immunity, "good faith" immunity, qualified immunity, absolute immunity, or other immunity based on his or her governmental status.

14.8 No Governmental Entity, nor any Governmental Person thereof may, by legislative, regulatory, or other action, exempt such Governmental Entity, subunit, or person, from the terms of this License Agreement, if the Governmental Entity or any such person has voluntarily used, modified, copied, displayed, performed, or distributed the Software or any part thereof.

14.9 Enforcement In Courts of Other Sovereigns Permitted. By using, modifying, changing, displaying, performing or distributing any Software covered by this License Agreement, any Governmental Entity hereby voluntarily and irrevocably consents, for purposes of (i) any action to enforce the terms of this License Agreement, and (ii) any action to enforce the Author's copyright (whether such suit be for injunctive relief, damages, or both) to the jurisdiction of any court or tribunal in any other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction of a subunit, province, or state of such country) in which the terms of this License Agreement are believed by the Author to be enforceable. Each such Governmental Entity hereby waives all objections to personal jurisdiction, all objections based on international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or governmental status or immunity that might otherwise be asserted in the courts of some other sovereign.

14.9.1 The Waiver by any Governmental Entity of a country other than the United States shall be understood explicitly to constitute a waiver for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (see Subparagraphs 14.2.1to 14.2.4, inclusive, supra), and all United States Governmental Entities shall be understood to have agreed to a waive correspondingly broad in scope with respect to actions brought in the courts of other sovereigns.

14.9.2 Forum Selection Non-U.S. Governmental Entities. Governmental Entities that are not United States Governmental Entities shall be subject to suit, and agree to be subject to suit, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The Author or an authorized end-user may bring an action in another court in another country, but the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, shall always be available as an agreed-upon forum for such an action. At the optional election of any Author (or, in the case of a third-party claim, any end-user asserting rights under Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10), such a suit against a non-U.S. Governmental Entity or Person may be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, as a direct substitute for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for all purposes of this Subparagraph.

14.9.3 Forum Selection U.S. Governmental Entities. All United States Governmental Entities shall be subject to suit, and agree to be subject to suit, in the following (non-exclusive) list of fora: Ottawa, Canada, London, England, and Paris, France. The Author or an authorized end-user may bring action in another court that can exercise jurisdiction. But the courts in these three locations shall always be available (at the option of the Author or an authorized end-user) as a forum for resolving any dispute with the United States or a governmental subunit thereof. Except as provided in Subparagraph 14.10, any and all United States Governmental Persons shall be subject to suit wherever applicable rules of personal jurisdiction and venue shall permit such suit to be filed, but no such United States Governmental Person may assert any defense based on forum non conveniens or international comity, to the selection of any particular lawful venue.

14.10 Enforcement Of Claims For Human Rights Violations. By using, copying, modifying, changing, performing, displaying or distributing the Software covered by this License Agreement, any Governmental Entity, or Governmental Person hereby voluntarily and irrevocably consents -- for purposes of any third-party action to remedy human rights violations and other violations of this License Agreement (as reflected in Section 14.3) -- to the jurisdiction of any court or tribunal in any other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction of a subunit, province, or state of such country) in which the third-party beneficiary reasonably believes the relevant terms of this License Agreement are enforceable. The Governmental Entity or Person hereby waives all objections to personal jurisdiction, all objections based on international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or governmental status or immunity that might otherwise be asserted in the courts of some other sovereign.

14.10.1 Waiver of Immunity and Forum Selection. The presumptively valid and preferred fora identified in Subparagraphs 14.9.2 and 14.9.3 shall also apply for purposes of Subparagraph 14.10. All Governmental Entities are subject to the same Waiver of Immunity as set forth in Subparagraphs 14.2.1 to 14.2.4, inclusive.
